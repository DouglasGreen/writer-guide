# Grammar

## What are the basic word types?

* common nouns, usually lowercase and found in the dictionary
* proper nouns, usually capitalized and not found in the dictionary
* quoted text

Anything that isn't common nouns and proper nouns should be quoted.

## What are the basic units of text?

The units of text are defined as in Markdown:

* headings
* paragraphs
* ordered lists
* unordered lists
* tables

A heading should usually be a noun phrase, not a complete sentence. Each noun phrase should start with a lowercase
letter and not end with a period.

A paragraph should consist of a series of complete sentences. Each sentence should start with a capital letter and end
with a period or a colon. Sentences end with a colon if they're followed by quoted text or a list. A list can be a
separate section containing an ordered or unordered list or just a comma separated list.

The difference between a sentence and a noun phrase is that a sentence has an independent verb but a noun phrase
doesn't.

Each section should be separated from the next section by a single blank line.

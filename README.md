# writer-guide

This project offers a set of guidelines for writers. The emphasis is written English prose, especially for software
documentation. The emphasis is on text that's easy to read, parse, and translate.

Comments and contributions are welcome.

## Guidelines

* Each section or question should cover a single topic.
* The answers should be short and should link to relevant sources.
* The vocabulary should be simple and consistent.
* The explanations should be clear enough for novice writers to understand.
* The emphasis should be on practical advice and not merely on interesting discussions.
